title: Image Metrology
description: An internship in Dortmund, DE led me to developing my skills in image metrology and software engineering. My most intensive project in coding, the support I received from my supervisors helped me increase the resolution and detection capabilities of their software near tenfold.

I was involved in all aspects of Dortmund's sensor preparations for ATLAS phase II over the course of that summer. I enjoyed most helping to functionalize the coldbox (used for temperature cycling) and adding code specifically designed to measure the principle angles of the sensor in any given micro-photograph. This was very useful for gaining more precision in sensor dimensions!

The significance of this was to ensure that in the future, all fabricated sensors that TU Dort. would produce are up to a tight standard of construction. Any tiny sensor defect could balloon into missed weeks of collision time and over thousands of dollars lost.
