I am currently just past the undergraduate stages of my life. Tune in later to see what graduate institution I find myself working in. Tune in too late, and ... you may miss my PhD!

As of now I am looking most into quantum information science as my future. I am very interested in studing entanglement, when interactions between quantum states leave an invisible "link" between them. This amazing structure likely plays a significant role for matter at small enough scales, and I think we are far from discovering all uses for it (yet!). Additionally, there is amazing utility that people have found in quantum simulation, where using the tunable environment of lightwaves, condensed helium or superatoms, scientists can model foreign phenomena like black holes or even the big bang.

Please contact me with any research opportunities or questions regarding QIS or physics simulations. When I am not a full time student I am full time employed - it may take a day or two for response.
